# Monet Color

TypeScript implementation of Android 12 Material You dynamic theme engine (named **Monet**).

## Background
Most code is from [android12-extensions](https://github.com/kdrag0n/android12-extensions), [colorkt](https://github.com/kdrag0n/colorkt) and [material-color-utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities).

[android12-extensions](https://github.com/kdrag0n/android12-extensions) was created by [Danny Lin(@kdrag0n)](https://twitter.com/kdrag0n) to implement "monet". And his implementation is better than Google's in most scenarios;

[material-color-utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) was open sourced by Google that including choosing theme colors from images and creating tones of colors which powers `Material Design 3` color system.

I combined these library, and optimized choosing theme colors from images of `material-color-utilities`.

Thanks to these authors's greate working.
